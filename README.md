For the last full moon of the year: a warehouse of process-experiments, design-practice, etc.

In December, I'm going full experiment for Ambient. Initially I planned on learning how to make new types of games closer to what we were planning on making, but I think I'm going to deep dive into process instead, to see: What decisions do I make in the process of actually constructing a small game? I'm not too worried about coming up with solutions for how to make those steps easier, I want to illuminate moments that show what the design process actually looks like -- what do I get hung up on? What might someone else do, or get hung up on?
