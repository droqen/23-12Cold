2. The first step is, I need all the basics of a platformer.

		2b. Going deeper, there are particularities about Quote's movement...
		I'll have to tweak my player character's parameters, the keyboard
		inputs, etc.
		
3. I'll build a character controller first. I have a lot of experience with
this, so it should go fast.
	3a. Actually I'll create a small world for my character controller first,
	because without a floor I can't move around...
